# @proj-airi/plugin-sdk

Runtime-agnostic SDK for AIRI extensions.

## Extension Manifest

Each installable Extension package has an `extension.airi.json` file at its root. The current Host accepts only Manifest v2:

```json
{
  "manifestVersion": 2,
  "kind": "manifest.extension.airi.moeru.ai",
  "id": "example-extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "engines": {
    "airi": "*",
    "runtimes": ["electron"]
  },
  "entrypoints": {
    "electron": "./extension.mjs"
  },
  "permissions": {},
  "kits": {
    "uses": [
      {
        "id": "dev.airi.example",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "optional": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Manifest parsing is strict. Unknown fields, unsafe ids, empty entrypoints, and missing runtime entrypoints fail validation. Kit declarations use exact semantic versions. The manifest owns the Extension version used by the Host session. `defineExtension(...)` owns runtime setup and must use the same Extension id.

## Kit API Naming

Kits should hide transport details from extension authors. A normal extension should use a kit as a normal API object directly from setup:

```ts
const gamelets = await ctx.kits.use(gameletKit)
await gamelets.mount(input)
```

Explicit module scopes are an advanced lifecycle and attribution API. Use `module.kits.use(...)` only when the host needs a contribution to be associated with a sub-scope that may later be inspected, disposed, or restarted independently.

When a kit needs to work across process or network boundaries, expose shared Eventa invoke contracts from the kit package and build the client from those contracts. Do not introduce kit-specific transport method names such as `invokeGamelet`, `gameletRpc`, or `gameletRuntime`.

Use these names consistently:

| Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `gameletKitApis` | Shared Eventa API contract exported by the kit package. This is usually a map of `defineInvokeEventa(...)` entries. |
| `gameletKitService` | Host-side implementation of the kit behavior. It owns real side effects such as mounting, updating, and cleaning up UI. |
| `gameletKit` | The kit definition consumed by `ctx.kits.use(...)` or an optional module scope. It owns identity, version, availability policy, and client creation. |
| `gamelets` | The client instance returned to extension authors. Prefer a plural namespace when the client exposes multiple operations. |
| `createGameletKit(...)` | Factory that wires dependencies into `gameletKit`, including local client creation and remote Eventa-backed client creation. |

Example shape:

```ts
export const gameletKitApis = {
  mount: defineInvokeEventa<GameletMountResult, GameletMountInput>(
    'airi:kit:gamelet:mount',
  ),
}

export interface GameletKitService {
  mount: (input: GameletMountInput, scope: KitCallScope) => Promise<GameletMountResult>
}

export function createGameletKit(options: { service: GameletKitService }) {
  return defineKit<GameletClient>({
    id: 'kit.gamelet',
    version: '1.0.0',
    createClient(runtime) {
      return {
        mount: input => options.service.mount(input, runtime),
      }
    },
  })
}
```

Remote clients should reuse Eventa invoke instead of defining a parallel RPC protocol. Use a lazy context callback when the underlying transport can reconnect or be created after the client object:

```ts
const mount = defineInvoke(getContext, gameletKitApis.mount)

const gamelets = {
  mount(input: GameletMountInput) {
    return mount(input, scope)
  },
}
```

The shared artifact is the Eventa API contract, not the implementation function. Local clients may call `gameletKitService` directly; remote clients call the same API through Eventa. Both should expose the same authoring shape.
