# `@proj-airi/stage-shared`

Shared contracts and runtime-neutral helpers for AIRI stage applications and UI packages.

## Use this package

Use this package when a type or behavior must cross stage application boundaries without depending on Electron, browser-only code, or a feature UI package.

The `plugin-host` entrypoint owns the serializable Plugin Host snapshots exchanged between the Electron main process and shared renderer code:

```ts
import type { PluginHostDebugSnapshot } from '@proj-airi/stage-shared/plugin-host'
```

## Do not use this package

Keep Electron IPC definitions in the Electron application. Keep UI state and actions in `@proj-airi/stage-ui`. Keep Extension runtime and manifest behavior in `@proj-airi/plugin-sdk`.

Do not add application startup, persistence, or platform-specific side effects here.
