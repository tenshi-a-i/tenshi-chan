 * silhouette changes far more slowly than the screen behind it, so this
 * interval is deliberately longer than the capture interval: raising the
 * capture rate must not raise the cost of this read.
 *
 * Moving the window still invalidates the cache at once, because a mask read at
 * another position indexes the wrong frame pixels. A drag therefore pays one
